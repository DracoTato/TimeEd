                <h2>Why Time Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is essential for both teachers and students,
                    as it fosters productivity, reduces stress, and enhances
                    overall performance. For teachers, managing time effectively
                    allows them to plan lessons, assess student work, and
                    balance administrative tasks without feeling overwhelmed. It
                    also enables them to dedicate more energy to personalized
                    support for their students. For students, learning time
                    management cultivates discipline, helps them meet deadlines,
                    and provides a sense of control over their studies, leading
                    to better academic outcomes and personal growth. With the
                    right tools, both teachers and students can maximize their
                    potential and achieve their goals efficiently.

                <h2>About TimeEd</h2>
                <p>
                    I just sat there one day and wondered how teachers manage
                    their time? How can they do all of that stuff without
                    getting overwhelmed? It's not unusual for some teachers to
                    work more than 12 hours a day! I would definitely get burnt
                    out after a couple of days (that's if I lasted a day). So I
                    thought of TimeEd, a time management tool primarily for
                    teachers, but students can use it too! You can easily
                    set/cancel/delete sessions, and we'll keep both you and your
                    students updated ^_^ and that was the main idea. I hope you
                    enjoy TimeEd.
